    <h2>Luan Loureiro</h2>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>Hi everyone, I'm Luan from this beautiful country called Brazil. I'm 24 years old.
    <p>I'm married to a wonderful daughter of God. I served a mission from 2017 to 2019, part in Nicaragua, but as the missions had to close there at that time, I finished my service in Curitiba Brazil South Mission, I loved serving in both places</p>
    <p>Currently I have two jobs, both are in the sales area, however my plan is to get a job in the area I'm studying till the next year.</p>
    I'm here to learn about web developement because I feel that's the best way for my family, being part of BYU-I, I've been a better disciple of Jesus Christ studying at a Church university. I love serving in the church, especially in the Temple</p>
    <p>Meeting new cultures and people is a hobby for me, if you want someone to talk to you can talk to me. I especially love the Asian culture, mostly Korean, like the food is amazing, and the K-pop songs are always on my daily playlist </p>
    <p>My favorite sport as a good Brazilian is football or soccer as the Americans call it, but I have been venturing into new physical challenges, such as gym and running, it's great to feel like we are progress in all areas of our lives.</p>
